=============
Version 0.3.2
=============
This release just fixes a bug in AppObject.Update
and stores repository files in $XDG_CACHE_HOME dir.

	* Emit Status and InstallFinished when calling AppObject.Update. 'INDEX' is used as plugin id.
	* Store repository XML files in $XDG_CACHE_HOME/capuchin or $HOME/.cache/capuchin. Log files are still stored in $HOME/.capuchin
	* Require ndesk-dbus

=============
Version 0.3.1
=============
In this release the behavior of AppObject's Update method changed.
It's now always called blocking, therefore the UpdateFinished signal
has been removed.

Changes:
    * Fixed bug that downloaded file will be deleted even if it's no archive
    * Strip bad characters from object path
    * Added support for Content-Disposition
    * Made AppObject.Update a blocking call.
    * Removed UpdateFinished signal, because it's not needed anymore.

=============
Version 0.3.0
=============

D-Bus daemon, new D-Bus API and slightly changed XML file format.

=============
Version 0.2.3
=============
This release is build upon the managed D-Bus 0.5.2, because it's the first release
that is thread-safe. In addition, a DownloadManager interface was added. As always
some bugs were fixed as well.
