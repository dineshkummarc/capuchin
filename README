Capuchin

Capuchin is an open-source program that runs in the background,
downloads and installs plugins. It can be used by any application through its D-Bus interface.
It's licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2.

The idea for Capuchin emerged from the Deskbar-Applet project. The goal for Capuchin is to provide
an easy way to upgrade plugins of any application. Therefore, it is very easy for developers
to enhance their application with a plugin update service.

The frist prototyp was written in Python. The current version is written in C# using Mono
and runs in the background as a D-Bus service. An application that wants to use Capuchin
connects to its D-Bus Interface and calls the appropriate method and Capuchin simply does its job.
